Ding dong merrily on high,
In heav'n the bells are ringing:
Ding dong! verily the sky
Is riv'n with angel singing.
Glor or orrrror0ororooorrroroorooroorria,
Hosanna in excelsis!

E'en so here below, below,
Let steeple bells be swungen,
And "Io, io, io!"
By priest and people sungen.
Glor or orror0ororooorrroroo7ooroorr1a,
Hosanna in excelsis!
